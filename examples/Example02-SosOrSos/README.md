# Example 2 - SOS or SOS

Send the distress signal properly in Morse code using the Arduino built-in LED.

In this example you will learn how to send prosigns, which are Morse code
patterns created by combining multiple letters as one.

The distress signal SOS is a prosign and in Morse code it does not look like
three letters, but one!
