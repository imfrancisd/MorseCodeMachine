# Example 7 - Local Speed Control

Send Morse code at different speeds using the built-in LED in the Arduino.

You will control the speed using local variables.

# Y.O.U. Are Making This Hard

Don't worry. You won't need to do this kind of thing until:

* global variables become too difficult to manage
* you want to use the sendMorse function, which was written in a C programming style, in classes and objects using a C++ programming style.

Just know that this functionality is available for you in this library.
